<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parking Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electromagnetic Parking Sensor</li><li>Ultrasonic Reversing Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Parking sensors are devices used in vehicles to assist drivers in parking and avoid collisions. There are two types of parking sensors - electromagnetic and ultrasonic. Electromagnetic parking sensors use electromagnetic waves to detect obstacles around the vehicle and provide audio-visual signals to the driver. Ultrasonic reversing sensors, on the other hand, use ultrasonic waves to measure the distance between the vehicle and obstacles, providing feedback to the driver. Both types of sensors enhance the safety and convenience of parking by alerting drivers to potential hazards.</p></p>
