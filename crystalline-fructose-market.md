<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystalline Fructose Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Starch Hydrolysis</li><li>Sucrose Hydrolysis</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The crystalline fructose market consists of two main types: starch hydrolysis and sucrose hydrolysis. In starch hydrolysis, starch is broken down into its constituent molecules, glucose, and then converted into fructose through a series of chemical reactions. Sucrose hydrolysis, on the other hand, involves breaking down sucrose into its individual molecules, glucose, and fructose. These methods are used to produce crystalline fructose, a sweetener that is widely used in several industries including food and beverages.</p></p>
