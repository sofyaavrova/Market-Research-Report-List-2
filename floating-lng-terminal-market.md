<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floating LNG Terminal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating LNG Import Terminals</li><li>Floating LNG Export Terminals</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Floating LNG terminals are types of infrastructure used in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry. Floating LNG import terminals are used to receive LNG from export countries, store it, and convert it back into its gaseous form for distribution within the importing country. On the other hand, floating LNG export terminals handle the liquefaction process, transforming natural gas into LNG and enabling it to be transported to other countries via LNG carriers. Both types of terminals play a crucial role in facilitating the trade and distribution of LNG globally.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Floating LNG Terminal Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FPSOs</li><li>FSRUs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Floating LNG terminals, including FPSOs (Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading) and FSRUs (Floating Storage and Regasification Units), are innovative solutions to enable the production, storage, and transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in remote offshore locations. FPSOs act as floating production facilities, extracting and storing LNG until it is ready for offloading onto transport vessels. FSRUs, on the other hand, receive LNG from transport vessels, store it, and then convert it back into natural gas for onshore distribution. These floating terminals provide flexibility and efficiency in LNG operations, especially in areas with limited onshore infrastructure.</p></p>
