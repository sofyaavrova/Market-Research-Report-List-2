<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Underfloor Heating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heating Cable</li><li>Electrothermal</li><li>Carbon Crystal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric underfloor heating is a heating system that is installed beneath the floor surface to provide warmth and comfort in a room. There are three main types of electric underfloor heating systems in the market: heating cable, electrothermal, and carbon crystal. </p><p>Heating cable systems consist of cables that are laid out in a specific pattern beneath the floor. When electricity is passed through these cables, they generate heat, which warms up the floor and radiates upwards to heat the room.</p><p>Electrothermal systems use thin heating mats that are made up of conductive materials. These mats are placed directly beneath the floor covering and produce heat when electricity is passed through them.</p><p>Carbon crystal systems utilize special heating panels that are made of a conductive carbon crystal material. When electricity flows through these panels, they emit infrared radiation, which directly heats the objects and people in the room.</p><p>All three types of electric underfloor heating systems are effective in providing comfortable and efficient heating solutions for residential and commercial spaces.</p></p>
